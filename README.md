wi-fi-display-pc
================

An application that implements the Wi-Fi Display specification for mirroring a PC's display to a compatible TV or other device. Hopefully after that is complete, mirroring of other devices onto the PC's screen can be implemented.

While the application will not be certified as Miracast compatible, the goal is to get the application working with as many Miracast certified devices as possible.

NOTE: Development has ceased on this project, and it's not useable in its current state.
